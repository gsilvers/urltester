urltester

This is just a simple python class I've created to expand on what used to be a script 
before altering server configs be it script versions or apache conf changes or even 
code changes I would bench the testing machines vs the prod machine to see which would
spit out the result first. 

This only works on testing http servers as I'm using urllib a future change may be
to extend this to allow multiple test types such as ping 

see urluser.py for an example of how to use this object

to use on your own system just create a directory and clone

$ mkdir urltester
$ cd urlteser
$ git clone git://github.com/gsilvers/urltester.git
$ have fun and enjoy the code

Here's the Code in Use:
